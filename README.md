# Pale Nimbus

A Business Card Web Component

## Development Notes
- the purpose of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of the Custom Elements and Shadow DOM APIs, and the HTML `template` and `slot` elements.
- The result will be an extensible "business card" in the style of American Psycho
  - an icing-on-the cake feature will be the "reverse side" that shows when clicked, and contains an image, github, linkedin, email, etc.
  - a cherry on top of that icing is to add JS that allows the viewer to dynamically render card details.
